"Write-ObjectToSQL","Writes an object into a database table. If the table does not exist it will be created based on the properties of the object. For every property of the object a column will be created. The data type for each column will be converted from .Net data types into SQL Server data types.

Not all data types are supported. Unsupported data types will be ignored (but can be listed). If several objects are sent through the pipeline only the first object will be used for creating the template for the table.

Make sure that all objects in the pipeline have the exact same properties (this is usually the case). While creating the table the script will also add two default columns. One called 'id' which is a regular auto counter (integer which increases with 1 for every row) and another column called 'inserted_at' which will have a default value of GetDate() which represents the timestamp for when the row was inserted. If a property is named the same as one of these default columns then a 'x' will be added before the name of those columns to avoid duplication. (if propertyname=id, then propertyname=xid, etc.)

Hashtables are handled slightly different. When using hashtables the script will simply use the keys as columns.
       
Keep in mind that properties on the objects are used. Some objects, like strings, might only have a length property but what you really want to insert into the table is the value of the string.
    
The following command would generate a table with one column called Length which would contain the length of the strings (probably not what you want):
    
'oink','meo' | Write-ObjectToSQL -Server localhost\sqlexpress -Database MyDB -TableName myTable
    
The following command is a better way to do it. Instead of piping the strings directly you should create custom objects or, as in this example, hash tables. This will generate a table with a column called 'text' which will contain the values 'oink' and 'meo':

@{'text'='oink'}, @{'text'='meo'} | Write-ObjectToSQL -Server localhost\sqlexpress -Database MyDB -TableName myTable

Another thing to note is that this script will only take Property and NoteProperty into consideration. So for example ScriptProperty and ParameterizedProperty will be ignored. You can verify your objects with the Get-Member cmdlet and check the MemberType.

Currently the script supports the following data types:

Int32
UInt32
Int16
UInt16
Int64
UInt64
long
int
Decimal
Single
Double

"ThreadJob","PowerShell's built-in BackgroundJob jobs (Start-Job) are run in separate processes on the local machine.
They provide excellent isolation but are resource heavy.  Running hundreds of BackgroundJob jobs can quickly
absorb system resources.

This module extends the existing PowerShell BackgroundJob to include a new thread based ThreadJob job.  This is a 
lighter weight solution for running concurrent PowerShell scripts that works within the existing PowerShell job 
infrastructure.

ThreadJob jobs will tend to run quicker because there is lower overhead and they do not use the remoting serialization 
system.  And they will use up fewer system resources.  In addition output objects returned from the job will be
'live' since they are not re-hydrated from the serialization system.  However, there is less isolation.  If one
ThreadJob job crashes the process then all ThreadJob jobs running in that process will be terminated.

This module exports a single cmdlet, Start-ThreadJob, which works similarly to the existing Start-Job cmdlet.
The main difference is that the jobs which are created run in separate threads within the local process.

One difference is that ThreadJob jobs support a ThrottleLimit parameter to limit the number of running jobs,
and thus active threads, at a time.  If more jobs are started then they go into a queue and wait until the current
number of jobs drops below the throttle limit.

FormatPx fixes this problem by attaching format data to objects rather than replacing objects with format data. This allows for data processing to continue beyond Format-* cmdlets, without losing any of the capabilities of the formatting engine in PowerShell. FormatPx also removes formatting limitations in the output layer, allowing multiple contiguous formats returned by a single command to render properly in PowerShell."

Enable-SSHRemoting cmdlet:
--------------------------
PowerShell SSH remoting was implemented in PowerShell 6.0 but requries SSH (client) and SSHD (service) components 
to be installed.  In addition the sshd_config configuration file must be updated to define a PowerShell endpoint
as a subsystem.  Once this is done PowerShell remoting cmdlets can be used to establish a PowerShell remoting
session over SSH that works across platforms.

$session = New-PSSession -HostName LinuxComputer1 -UserName UserA -SSHTransport

There are a number of requirements that must be satisfied for PowerShell SSH based remoting:
  a. PowerShell 6.0 or greater must be installed on the system.
       Since multiple PowerShell installations can appear on a single system, a specific installation can be selected.
  b. SSH client must be installed on the system as PowerShell uses it for outgoing connections.
  c. SSHD (ssh daemon) must be installed on the system for PowerShell to receive SSH connections.
  d. SSHD must be configured with a Subsystem that serves as the PowerShell remoting endpoint.

The Enable-SSHRemoting cmdlet will do the following:
  a. Detect the underlying platform (Windows, Linux, macOS).
  b. Detect an installed SSH client, and emit a warning if not found.
  c. Detect an installed SSHD daemon, and emit a warning if not found.
  d. Accept a PowerShell (pwsh) path to be run as a remoting PowerShell session endpoint.
       Or try to use the currently running PowerShell.
  e. Update the SSHD configuration file to add a PowerShell subsystem endpoint entry.

If all of the conditions are satisfied then PowerShell SSH remoting will work to and from the local system."

"PublishDacPac","Deploy a SQL Database DACPAC using a DAC Publish Profile

Publish-DacPac allows you to deploy a SQL Server Database DACPAC to a SQL Server instance using a DAC Publish Profile.

SSDT (SQL Server Data Tools) is Microsoft's tool to design (declare) the entire database model including tables, views, stored procedures, functions, schemas, etc. etc. etc. SSDT covering all aspects of a database design.

SSDT is now fully integrated into Visual Studio. When you perform a build of a SSDT Visual Studio project, it creates a DACPAC which defines all of the SQL Server objects - like tables, views, and instance objects, including logins - associated with a database.

Publish-DacPac simplifies the use of SqlPackage.exe to deploy a DACPAC by using a DAC Publish Profile which provides for fine-grained control over the database creation and upgrades, including upgrades for schema, triggers, stored procedures, roles, users, extended properties etc. Using a DAC Publish Profile, multiple different properties can be set to ensure that the database is created or upgraded properly.

Publish-DacPac compares the content of a DACPAC to the database already on the target server and generates a deployment script. You can tailor how publish works using a DAC Publish Profile.

Publish-DacPac can be used to automate the deployment of databases, either as part of a build in  DevOps, or part of a server deployment using Octopus Deploy or  DevOps Release Manager.

To automate build and deployment of databases in  DevOps, you can use MsBuild to create DACPAC from your Visual Studio solution. You can then add a PowerShell task which uses Publish-DacPac to invoke SQLPackage.exe to deploy each DACPAC using your own custom DAC Publish Profile.

Full documentation can be found on our project site https://github.com/DrJohnT/PublishDacPac"

"OledbSql","A Powershell module that provides a simple means to connect to any OleDB compatible database and execute SQL queries, returning the results as piped objects.


FEATURES

 * Tables are returned as System.Management.Automation.PSCustomObject objects, whose type can be specified with the TypeName parameter.
 * Scalar results (update, insert, delete, etc) are returned as an integer value representing the quantity of rows affected.
 * The returned objects' parameters are automaticly cast from their datbase types to their .Net equivalents.
 * Connection strings can be saved with an alias for ease of use.
 * Connection strings can contain parameters that query the user for input. Particularly useful for passwords.
 * Duplicate column names are automatically given unique property names.
 * Uses OleDb.Net. Though OleDb.net is not as fast as a native provider, it is very flexable. For databases with an OleDB.net provider, the same code will work by appending the correct 'Provider' clause to the connection string. See SQLConnections.txt for examples.


EXAMPLE

    $ConnectionString = 'Provider=sqloledb; Data Source=%Server%; Initial Catalog=%Database%;Integrated Security=SSPI;'
    $ConnectionObject = New-SqlConnection -ConnectionString $ConnectionString
    Invoke-OledbSql -Connection $ConnectionObject -SQL 'select 1 as Ping'

This example creates a connection object, querying the user for the database and server names. It then issues a simple select that returns a '1' if the connection succeeds."

The list of availble sounds are not hard-coded; they are retrieved and stored automatically from Pushover. Any parameters that have character limitations are checked for compliance.

The Pushover Groups API is also fully implemented. This allows retrieving of group membership, adding and removing users from groups, enabling and disabling users temporarily, and renaming groups.

Commands are available for the Licensing API that allow you to assign a license to a user, and to check the remaining licenses for an application.

PushoverForPS also includes automatic rate limiting. According to the Pushover API, any identical requests should not be repeated within five seconds of each other. This module checks each request to ensure that it does not match a request sent within the last five seconds. If it has, it will hold the request until five seconds has elapsed.
    
Receive-PushoverReceipt can be set up to poll the Pushover API periodically as a background job to wait until the Emergency notification has been acknowledged. See Get-Help Receive-PushoverReceipt for more information.

For more information run Get-Help PushoverForPS.

"GithubFS","# GithubFS
A provider for powershell which uses octokit to let you use github repos as a filesystem inside powershell

##Usage
Install the `GithubFS` PSModule to a modules directory of your choice, then import it in your profile with
```powershell
ipmo GithubFS
```
Additionally, visit github and grab a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). (You should 
probably give it user and repo permissions) Drop that in your profile like so:
```powershell
$env:GITHUB_TOKEN = '<token>';
```
Great! Now once you refresh your shell you should have access to a `GH:` drive which contains all the orgs/users you
know about! You should be able to use it just like it was a filesystem, however not all applications are capable
of using PSProviders for input paths.

##Detail
The `GithubProvider` project contains a few C# classes used to bind the Github API to a PSProvider and register
the provider.
The `GithubFS` project is a powershell module which loads the `GithubProvider` and, additionally, provides a few
useful cmdlets for manipulating and using the github psprovider. 

###Provided Cmdlets
####Out-Github

to recreate the unavailable stream support. It is aliased to override `Out-File` so that it polyfills support for

"PublicIPAddress","PublicIPAddress is a PowerShell module for querying public IPv4/IPv6-address and save the IP-address to a file. Optionally can also create a scheduled task to do this periodically.

Most Internet-connections, especially wireless connections have dynamic IP-address that will change at times.

As such it may prove to be challenging to remotely connect to your computer from the Internet. One of the most popular ways to address the issue is to use a service such as DynDNS which provices a static hostname, eg myhomecomputer.domain.net.

But unless you actually need to use a static hostname, an alternative way is to leverage Dropbox, OneDrive, Google Drive or similar cloud service to store public IP-address of your computer in a file.

All you need is a way to periodically check current public IP-address and save that to a file located in a directory that will be synced to a cloud service, which you can then read on your phone or any other computer with access to the Internet.

This PowerShell module provides a function to check current public IP-address and write the IP-address to a file in specified directory. In addition to this, a scheduled task can be created to do this periodically.

If you intend to use a scheduled task, this module should be installed to %systemdrive%:\Program Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules. Otherwise SYSTEM account cannot find this module and use its functions.

Administrator privileges will also be required to create a scheduled task.

When installing this module from the PowerShell Gallery, use ""Install-Module -Name PublicIPAddress -Scope AllUsers"" in order to install the module to Program Files.

Queries for IP-address should be limited to no more than once per five minutes. Otherwise your queries my be dropped."

PoshChocobear exits is to install chocolatey with the choco-bear feed and choco-bear extension for chocolatey and to make configured installs with multiple feeds easier to setup.

It includes additional functions Install-ChocolateyPackage and Remove-ChocolateyPackage that wrap choco install, upgrade, and emove commands. 

The value in having powershell functions that wrap those commands is the autocomplete feature for PowerSheel commands and the ease of passing in  arguments to parameters like <c>-Params</c> which maps to Chocolatey's --params</c>, <c>--package-parameters</c>parameter. 

In the future, PoshChocobear will include Install-ChocoBearPackage and Remove-ChocoBearPackage will include standard package parameters for the packages in the choco-bear feed such as -NoInstall, -User for user scoped installs instead of machine level installs, etc.

"FogApi","This module is used to easily run Fog API commands on your fogserver from a powershell console or script.
    This essentially gives you a crossplatform commandline interface for fog tasks and makes many things easier to automate.

    The documentation is hosted on readthedocs at https://fogapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

    To install this module you need at least powershell v3, was created with 5.1 and intended to be cross platform compatible with powershell v6
    To Install this module follow these steps
    * Easiest method: Install from PSGallery https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/FogApi Install-Module -name fogApi

    * Manual Method:
    * download the zip of this repo and extract it and use Import-Module on the extracted path

    The module is now installed.
    You can use Set-fogserverSettings to set your fogserver hostname and api keys.
    The first time you try to run a command the settings.json file will automatically open
    in notepad on windows, nano on linux, or TextEdit on Mac
    You can also open the settings.json file and edit it manually before running your first command.
    The default settings are explanations of where to find the proper settings since json can''t have comments

    Once the settings are set you can have a jolly good time utilzing the fog documentation
    found here https://news.fogproject.org/simplified-api-documentation/ that was used to model the parameters

    i.e.

    Get-FogObject has a type param that validates to object, objectactivetasktype, and search as those are the options given in the documentation.
    Each of those types validates (which means autocompletion) to the core types listed in the documentation.
    So if you typed in Get-FogObject -Type object -Object  h and then started hitting tab, it would loop through the possible core objects you can get from the api that start with ''h'' such as history, host, etc.

    Unless you filter a get with a json body it will return all the results into a powershell object. That object is easy to work with to create other commands. Note: Full Pipeline support will come at a later time
     i.e.

     hosts = Get-FogObject -Type Object -CoreObject Host # calls get on http://fog-server/fog/host to list all hosts
     Now you can search all your hosts for the one or ones you''re looking for with powershell
     maybe you want to find all the hosts with ''IT'' in the name  (note ''?'' is an alias for Where-Object)
    ITHosts = hosts.hosts | ? name -match ''IT'';

    Now maybe you want to change the image all of these computers use to one named ''IT-Image''
    You can edit the object in powershell with a foreach-object (''%'' is an alias for foreach-object)
    updatedITHosts = ITHosts | % { _.imagename = ''IT-image''}

    Then you need to convert that object to json and pass each object into one api call at a time. Which sounds complicated, but it''s not, it''s as easy as
    
    updateITHosts | % {
        jsonData = _ | ConvertTo-Json;
        Update-FogObject -Type object -CoreObject host -objectID _.id -jsonData jsonData;
        #successful result of updated objects properties
        #or any error messages will output to screen for each object
    }
    
    This is just one small example of the limitless things you can do with the api and powershell objects.

The SRXEnv hashtable provides the following keys:

[string] ReportEmail: (3.10.4133.0)
If you have an SMTP server available, the ScriptRunner service can send you email
notifications containing execution reports, on error or on success.
Recipient email address (comma separated list). The full action report will be sent to this address.

[string] ResultEmail: (3.10.4133.0)
Recipient email addresses (comma separated list). Only the ResultMessage will be sent to this address.

[string] ResultHtml: (5.2.6155.0)
The ScriptRunner PowerShell host supports HTML results through the $SRXEnv.ResultHtml variable.
The HTML web page can then be easily retrieved from the ScriptRunner Portal, Apps and WebApps.
For example, you can use the ConvertTo-Html cmdlet to assign HTML to the ResultHTML variable.
There are new sample scripts in the Expl/Common folder of the ScriptRunner ScriptRepository that
show how to create the HTML in your scripts.

[ArrayList] ResultList: (4.0.4511.0)
A scripted query must specify this list of string values. The list is associated with
the corresponding action parameter.

[ArrayList] ResultList2: (4.0.4511.0)
A scripted query can specify this optional list of display names. The list appears as
drop-down list for the associated action parameter.

[string] ResultMessage: (3.00.3670.0)
This message will show in the reports, and in the immediate result window of the Portal, Delegate and
Self-Service App.

[string] ResultObjectJSON: (4.1.4738.0)
The script can now provide (simple) structured result data by writing a (small) JSON string to $SRXEnv.ResultObjectJSON.
ScriptRunner will provide this JSON string in the OutSerializedPSObjects report field,
for post-processing by the caller of the Web Service Connector.

[string] SRXActionID: (6.2.577.0)
The ID of the started Action. (read-only)

[string] SRXCommandPath: (6.2.642.0)
Full filepath of the executed script file used by the started Action (similar
to the PowerShell $PSCommandPath auto-variable). (read-only)

[string] SRXDisplayName: (4.1.4738.0)
The name of the current action. (read-only)

[string] SRXFilterValue: (6.2.577.0)
In case of query execution, this key contains the current filter value
from the search filter form in the UI. (read-only)

[DateTime] SRXStarted: (4.1.4738.0)
The timestamp of the start of the script execution. (read-only)

[string] SRXStartedBy: (4.1.4738.0)
The user account that requested the execution of the script. (read-only)

[string] SRXStartedIP: (4.1.4738.0)
IP address of the client that sent the request to perform the script execution. (read-only)

[string] SRXStartedReason: (4.1.4738.0)
A reason message written by the user who started the Action. (read-only)

[string] SRXStartedVia: (4.1.4738.0)
The name of the application that started the execution of the script. (read-only)

"Gz-Db","# Gz-Db Module

Database agnostic Powershell functions over ADO.NET.

The primary functions are Invoke-GzDbCommand, Read-GzDbData, and Write-GzDbData. If
a connection or connectionString is not provided to the functions, the functions
will attempt to use the default connection set by Set-GzDbConnectionString.

Any function that has a `-Do` parameter, can be passed a script block that will
have the `$_` context variable set with either the connection or command object.

Sqlite is bundled with module.  To switch the default provider use:

```powershell
Set-GzDbProviderFactoryDefault ""Sqlite""
```

## Examples


- Set-GzDbConnectionString - sets the default or a named connection string.
- New-GzDbConnection - creates a new connection
- Write-GzDbData - inserts or updates data in the database.
- Read-GzDbData - reads data from the database.
- Invoke-GzDbCommand - executes a statement such as create database or grants.

```powershell
Set-GzDbConnectionString ""Server=localhost;Database=test;Integrate Security=true"" -Name ""Default""

# uses the default connection string set above 
$data = Read-GzDbData ""SELECT name FROM [users]""
Write-Host $data  

# control the connection
$connection = New-GzDbConnection -ConnectionString $cs
$connection.Open()

$emails = $connection | Read-GzDbData ""SELECT email FROM [users]""
$connection | Write-GzDbData ""INSERT [name] INTO [user_roles] ([name], [role]) VALUES (@name, 1)"" -Parameters @{name = ""test""}

$connection.Dispose()

# opens and closes the connection
# autocreates a `$Connection` variable
# returns any output.
$data = New-GzDbConnection -Do {
   return  $Connection | Read-GzDbData ""SELECT email FROM [users]""
}

```

## Gz Prefix

The Gz prefix exists to clobbering. 

Add-GzDbAlias will set aliases that map to GzDb functions .e.g. Invoke-DbCommand
will be mapped to Invoke-GzDbCommand."

This module can even run on a separate system where there's access to the IIS logs.

That is its diference from the Start-Process cmdlet which redirects output to file only. If redirecting output to file is enough for your purposes, you don't need this module.

The module exports two functions: Set-ConsoleAppStartupParameters and Start-ConsoleAppRedirectOutput.

The first function, Set-ConsoleAppStartupParameters, creates an object with set of parameters for the process.
To specify the program that runs in the process, enter full path to the executable file or path to folder containing the executable file and the name of the executable file.
You can also use remaining parameters of Set-ConsoleAppStartupParameters to specify command line arguments, working directory and encoding for output.

The second function, Start-ConsoleAppRedirectOutput, starts the process and returns the output as an array of strings.
You can specify command line arguments for application here or override them if they were specified earlier. You also may select an output type between standard output, standard errors or select both. And you may skip empty strings in the output or not (if you need it for some reason).
The array of strings returned from Start-ConsoleAppRedirectOutput can be parsed and used to create a new command line argument string for the same (or any other) console application."

"Microsoft.PowerShell.ThreadJob","PowerShell's built-in BackgroundJob jobs (Start-Job) are run in separate processes on the local machine.
They provide excellent isolation but are resource heavy.  Running hundreds of BackgroundJob jobs can quickly
absorb system resources.

This module extends the existing PowerShell BackgroundJob to include a new thread based ThreadJob job.  This is a 
lighter weight solution for running concurrent PowerShell scripts that works within the existing PowerShell job 
infrastructure.

ThreadJob jobs will tend to run quicker because there is lower overhead and they do not use the remoting serialization 
system.  And they will use up fewer system resources.  In addition output objects returned from the job will be
'live' since they are not re-hydrated from the serialization system.  However, there is less isolation.  If one
ThreadJob job crashes the process then all ThreadJob jobs running in that process will be terminated.

This module exports a single cmdlet, Start-ThreadJob, which works similarly to the existing Start-Job cmdlet.
The main difference is that the jobs which are created run in separate threads within the local process.

One difference is that ThreadJob jobs support a ThrottleLimit parameter to limit the number of running jobs,
and thus active threads, at a time.  If more jobs are started then they go into a queue and wait until the current
number of jobs drops below the throttle limit."
